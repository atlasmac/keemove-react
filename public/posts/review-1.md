KeeMove has been instrumental in providing our family tools for forward growth and daily skill development for our son. We are far better equipped to assist at home as we are given an understanding of the “why” in addition to the “how” of the therapies and unique techniques used through KeeMove. I love how the learning is made fun and is connection based. Regulation, refocusing, transitions, new tasks- all are made simply easier after KeeMove.
