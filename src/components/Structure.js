            Children canâ€™t always articulate their feelings verbally,
            so sometimes they somaticize their feelings. Your child might benefit from more structure
            if they are experiencing:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Constipation</li>
            <li>Extreme shyness or withdrawal</li>
            <li>Sensory sensitivities (e.g. prefers seated activities and dislike movement)</li>
            <li>Craves a lot of sensory input (e.g. could swing on the swing all day)</li>
            <li>Difficult sleeping</li>
            <li>Frequent outbursts</li>
          </ul>
          <p>To assist with emotional regulation development, children often benefit from education about emotions, body signals, strategies, and how to apply strategies.</p>
