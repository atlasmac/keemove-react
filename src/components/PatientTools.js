              Insurance: We accept most major insurances. Please note that a
              physician referral with an OT-related diagnosis is required for
              insurance billing. To request a referral, contact your primary
              care physician or your childâ€™s pediatrician and have them fax a
              referral to us at 406-519-0626.

          <h3>Payment Options and Fees</h3>
          <p>
            If you choose to have your insurance billed for your service, our
            biller will bill your insurance. Once the bill has been reviewed by
            your insurance, you will receive a bill 30-60 days after your
            appointment for the remaining portion owed. If you have a
            deductible, the deductible has to be met before your insurance will
            cover services rendered. You are responsible for all charges and
            expected to make monthly payments. Payments can be made over the
            phone to our biller or on the portal. The portal will not reflect an
            updated balance but is used for convenience.
          </p>

            Insurance billing questions can be directed to Back Office
            Solutions, LLC at 406-721-6701.
