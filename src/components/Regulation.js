            <p>Emotional regulation entails being aware of our emotions and being able to manage them in a positive way. Regulation is important because if we are not regulated it is hard for us to: learn, have fun, connect, etc. When helping our kids when they are frustrated or upset, we need to make sure that we are regulated. Kids can sense when we are not and that affects their ability to regulate. So, if you are frustrated or upset, take time for yourself if you can. Listed below is typical regulation development. </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Co-regulation - relying on adults for help to calm down</li>
              <li>Peer regulation - relying on peers for help to calm down</li>
              <li>Self regulation - relying on ourselves to calm down</li>
            </ul>
            <p>To assist with emotional regulation development, children often benefit from education about emotions, body signals, strategies, and how to apply strategies.</p>
