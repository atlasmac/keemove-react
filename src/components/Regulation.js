            <p>Emotional regulation means being aware of our emotions and being able to manage them in a positive way. Regulation helps us learn, have fun, and connect with others. When our children are frustrated or upset, we need to make sure that we are regulated. Children can sense when we are not and that affects their ability to regulate. So, if you are frustrated or upset, take time for yourself if you can. Listed below are three phases of regulation development. </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Co-regulation - relying on adults for help to calm down</li>
              <li>Peer regulation - relying on peers for help to calm down</li>
              <li>Self-regulation - relying on ourselves to calm down</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Children often benefit from learning about emotions, body signals, coping strategies, and how to apply coping strategies.</p>
