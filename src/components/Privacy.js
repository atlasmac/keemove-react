          We offer the opportunity for You to volunteer certain information to
          us that is used for email and marketing purposes. This information
          includes, but is not limited to, Your name and email. You will have an

          We take all reasonable steps to protect Your personal data and keep

          systems and implement generally accepted standards of security to
          protect against personal data loss or misuse. However, no security
          measure is foolproof, and no method of data transmission can be
          guaranteed against interception or misuse. We cannot guarantee
          complete security of any information You transmit to us.

          prevent the use or misuse of Your data by other parties.

        <p>
          In the unlikely event customer data has been lost, stolen, or
          potentially compromised, Our policy is to alert our customers via
          email no later than 72 hours of Our company becoming aware of the
          event. We will also report such incident to any required data
          protection authority. We will work closely with any customers affected
          to determine next steps such as any end-user notifications, needed
          patches, and how to avoid any similar event in the future.
        </p>

        <h2>PRIVACY POLICY CHANGES</h2>
        <p>
          Although most changes are likely to be minor, We may change our Privacy
